# Welcome
github.com/stewelarend provides a set of libraries that facilitates the development of systems consisting of micro-services.

The libraries abstracts some of the common components so that your service can focus on its core function and not care about dealing with the actual implementation of things like config, communication, stats, audits, logs etc.
